                <p>This moment isn’t just a day on the calendar. Today is National Girlfriend’s Day — a reminder of how lucky I am to have you by my side.</p>

                <p>Every moment I spend with you is like a gift.</p>

                <p>You’ve brought me many memories that I will cherish for eternity. With your smile being my favourite memory. It would always give me the fizziest feeling when you would smile.</p>

                <p>I’ve never felt so comfortable with anyone before. I feel at home when I’m with you. Everything feels so natural whenever I’m with you.</p>

                <p>As we continue this journey together I will support your dreams. I promise I will stand with you no matter what obstacles come at us. You deserve all the happiness in the world</p>

                <p>Thank you for being so patient with me and for loving me and lastly thank you for being who you are, for bringing so much joy into life and for accepting me even though I was problematic at first so I thank you for being so forgiving.</p>

                <p>You're not just my girlfriend, you're more than that, you're my safe place and my family. You’ll be the person that I’ll choose everyday.</p>
